🌊 Wetland Monitoring using NDWI (2019–2024)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes wetland changes in Loktak Lake, Manipur (India) using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Seasonal comparisons (Summer & Monsoon) were performed between 2019–2024 to study water spread dynamics.

The workflow includes:

Preprocessing Landsat bands (Green & NIR).

Computing NDWI = (Green – NIR) / (Green + NIR).

Applying a fixed threshold to generate water masks.

Comparing seasonal and temporal changes in wetland area.

Generating NDWI maps, water masks, and time-series plots.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

MATLAB (for image processing & visualization)

Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance data (USGS Earth Explorer)

NDWI (McFeeters, 1996) for water detection

📊 Results

Seasonal maps of wetland extent (Summer vs Monsoon).

Year-wise wetland area comparison (2019–2024).

NDWI difference maps showing water spread changes.

Time-series trend of wetland extent.

👩‍💻 Roles & Responsibilities (Keerthi’s contribution)

Processed Landsat imagery and implemented NDWI calculation in MATLAB.

Developed scripts for thresholding and water mask extraction.

Created wetland area tables, bar charts, and time-series plots.

Documented project workflow and analysis.

Would you like me to also make a shorter LinkedIn-style version of this README (just a 3–4 line description with highlights) so you can post both GitHub + LinkedIn together?
